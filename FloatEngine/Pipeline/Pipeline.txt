Since FNA does not feature its own pipeline, due to the creators being adamant that XNA's
is such a bad idea, and that 'to make your own in just a few days', until that day comes where
I become a programming GOAT, this engine will be using the MGCB pipeline.

Note: Please understand that using this pipeline is only for loading 3D Models (.fbx,.blend,.obj, and etc).
There is already a pipeline in place for textures, images, sprites, and anything else involving
SpriteBatch (2D Rendering).
