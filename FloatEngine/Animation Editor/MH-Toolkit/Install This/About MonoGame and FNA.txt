MonoGame and FNA are both open source recreations of the XNA 4.0 framework. In our coding series we'll be using FNA to make our games.

I recommend using FNA when developing for desktop platforms (PC, Mac, Linux) and using MonoGame when developing for other consoles
and handhelds (Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch etc.). The code you write in FNA and MonoGame transfer over
easily and usually require zero code changes. The only thing that changes is the code under the hood of each framework; so it's
nothing you should worry about.

Becuase both projects are a recreation of XNA 4, you can google XNA 4 tutorials and re use the code you find in MonoGame or FNA.

While it's true we're using FNA in our video series, I would also recommend installing the latest version of MonoGame. MonoGame
comes with a "Content Pipeline" tool that converts your assets (textures, audio, fonts etc.) into .XNB files that can be used for
different platforms you target.

As of writing this, FNA does not have a content pipeline tool... but it accepts any content built with the MonoGame Content Pipeline.

For the sake of simplicity, I try to never use the content pipeline in my video series. FNA accepts raw .png files for images, so I
take that route for our textures. However, some types of content (such as fonts) MUST use the Content Pipeline from MonoGame. So,
if you're looking at using the code we write in the long term I would highly recommend using the MonoGame Content Pipeline for all
content you use in your games.
