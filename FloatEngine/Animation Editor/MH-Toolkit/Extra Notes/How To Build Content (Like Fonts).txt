The MonoGame Content Pipeline is used to create .xnb files for our engine. The Content Manager can automatically compress
audio and textures, as well as convert them to proper formats for non-desktop platforms such as iOS or Xbox. The advantage
of using .xnb on PC is that your assets can be significantly smaller in size. Also, if you don't like the idea of giving
people raw .png files, using .xnb helps hide your assets from thieves!

On PC, you can choose to use raw files for your assets (like .png or .wav) or convert them to .xnb. However, fonts MUST be
created with the MonoGame Pipeline. Here's how to do it.

================================
How To Build Fonts
================================
1. Open the MonoGame Pipeline. If you don't have it you can get it by downloading the latest version of MonoGame at
http://www.monogame.net/downloads/

2. Go to File -> New and pick a place to save the file for this Content project.

3. Right click the only item in the top left window pane (it will be called whatever you named your Content project file)
and click Add -> New Item -> SpriteFont Description. This will generate a new .spritefont file.

4. Open the new .spritefont file inside a text editor, or inside of Visual Studio. You can now edit this file to your 
liking... you can change the name of the font you want to use, the size etc. inside this file. The font you want to 
generate for your game MUST be installed on your computer, and the name you type here must be exactly like it's named on
your machine. You can see the fonts installed on your computer by going to C:\Windows\Fonts

5. When you're done with all of your edits, return to the MonoGame Pipeline and click Build -> Build from the top menu. An
.xnb file will generate inside the bin folder next to the Content file you saved earlier. 

6. Inside your Visual Studio project you can now add the generated .xnb file. After adding it to your Content folder make
sure you set the "Copy to Output" option in the Properties window to "Copy if newer".
