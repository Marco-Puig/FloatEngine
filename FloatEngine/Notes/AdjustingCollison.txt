Find your GameObject that you want to adjust...
Needs to be deriving from the GameObject class;

Go into the Load() function
Then paste: boundingBoxHeight = image.Height; 

You can then adjust the height by subtracted or adding to decrease or increase the height.
You can do the same thing for the width as well.

Example:
boundingBoxHeight = image.Height - 10;
